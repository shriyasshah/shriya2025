# Tool Setup
Since I hadn't taken a previou CS class I had to start fresh and download tools like VS code, homebrew, python, and juypter. I ran into a few challenges with my Mac, but was eventually able to finish downloading everything needed. ALthough our class took a while to set up the tools we were eventually able to download all of them.
# Updating tools
Some of the tools I had downloaded needed updating before using for the class. After downloading and updating everything the rest of the setup was pretty straight forward. Each tool needed to be updated and after we downloaded additional extensions to make sure our coding went easier and smoother.
