Hi, my name is Shriya and I'm a junior at Del Norte! I am 16 years old and my birthday is on July 10th so I'm a Cancer! Outside of school I play soccer, I play for the highschool and club. I practice about 3 times a week but am probably not going to play for a college. I also volenteer through NCL (national charity league). In my family I have 2 younger sisters and a goldendoodle names Lucky. I joined CSP  because I am intrested in learning more about coding and it's what my dad does as a profession. I think this is going to be such a good learning experience! I'm currently taking a few AP classes and in the future I want to work as an OBGyn.
