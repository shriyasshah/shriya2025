# Sprint 3 Journey - Shriya Shah
During sprint 3 I worked the most on fronend specfically creating styles divs and creating the logo for our page. I specifically worked on styling the buttons and making borders for our page/posts. If one were to open my team's website I would be able to share and show what I worked on for the frontend. I also worked with Justin and my frontend partner Nathan to code the javascript for the frontend. This connected our styling code and formated the page as well as working with the backend.
