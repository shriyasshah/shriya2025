# Sprint 3 Journey - Shriya Shah
During sprint 3 I worked the most on fronend specfically creating styles divs and creating the logo for our page. I specifically worked on styling the buttons and making borders for our page/posts. If one were to open my team's website I would be able to share and show what I worked on for the frontend. I also worked with Justin and my frontend partner Nathan to code the javascript for the frontend. This connected our styling code and formated the page as well as working with the backend.

The first thing me and Nathan worked on was creating the logo for our website. This allowed it to look more appealing and official. 
<span>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/nestlogo.png" width = "500"  height = "300"/>
</span>

The majority of what I worked on was styling and html code to create borders and centering images, buttons, and text.  
<span>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/stylingfrontend.png" width = "500"  height = "300"/>
</span>

For actual code I worked on the frontend javascript that allowed our formating to work with the backend and create the borders and posts with the date and name of the person who uploded the image. This code that I worked with Justina and Nathan to create allowed us to get our frontend up and working. It took our code and created a cool post people could interact with!
