    "# Purpose of your groups program\n",
    "Our team created a platform that allows us to prepare and teach CSP students about Big Idea 2 (about Binary). This is a key part of the CSP course and the different features of our program will test your knowledge and help you prepare for the upcoming AP exam as well as do great in this class. \n",

    "# List requests\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The Quizgrading API supports the following requests: \n",
    "\n",
    "- GET /api/quizgrading: Retrieve quiz scores and attempts\n",
    "- POST /api/quizgrading: Add a new quiz score and attempt.\n",
    "- PUT /api/quizgrading: Update an existing quiz score and attempt entry.\n",
    "- DELETE /api/quizgrading: Delete a specific quiz attempt and score entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use of Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "In the API, we use lists to handle multiple quiz score and attempt entries to represent individual entries. The database rows are converted to dictionaries for JSON responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting database rows to list of dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "entries = QuizQradingEntry.query.order_by(QuizGrading.score.desc()).all()\n",
    "entries_list = [entry.read() for entry in entries]\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Formatting Response Data (JSON) from API into DOM\n",
    "We use Flask’s jsonify function to format the response data as JSON. In the frontend, we use JavaScript to fetch the JSON data from the API and update the DOM. This involves converting the JSON response into HTML elements to display the quiz scores and attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "- @quizgrading_api.route('/api/quizgrading', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_quizgrading():\n",
    "    entries = quizgrading.query.order_by(quizgrading.score.desc()).all()\n",
    "    return jsonify([entry.read() for entry in entries]), 200\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Database Queries\n",
    "We use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy provides methods to query the database and return results as Python lists. For example, we can retrieve all quiz entries sorted by quizgrade or attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Get all entries sorted by score\n",
    "entries = quizgrading.query.order_by(quizgrading.quizgrade.desc()).all()\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Filter by profile name\n",
    "entry = quizgrading.query.filter_by(attempt=attempt).first()\n",
    "\n",
    "5) CRUD Methods in Class\n",
    "We define methods in the QuizGrading class to perform CRUD operations on the database:\n",
    "Create: Adds a new entry to the database.\n",
    "Read: Converts a database entry to a dictionary.\n",
    "Update: Updates entry fields with new data.\n",
    "Delete: Removes an entry from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example: - class QuizGrading(db.Model):\n",
    "    1) Create\n",
    "    def create(self):\n",
    "        db.session.add(self)\n",

    "#  Algorithmic Code Request\n",
    "We define API endpoints to handle different types of requests. For example, the PUT request to update a quiz entry involves checking if the entry exists, updating the grade and attempt if it does, or creating a new entry if it doesn’t.\n",

    "1) API CLASS\n",

    "In the frontend, we use the fetch API to make requests to the backend. For example, to submit an attempt, we send a PUT request with the quizgrade and attempt. The response is handled by checking the status and updating the DOM accordingly. If the request is successful, we update the quiz attempt table; if there’s an error, we display an error message.\n",
