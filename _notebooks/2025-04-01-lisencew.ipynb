The license allows users to use, modify, and distribute the project without restrictions while ensuring that all modifications and derivative works are properly attributed. It also includes an express patent grant, which rules out future legal problems. With this license, my work is public and accessible and protects both the users and contributors from liability. This finally encourages cooperation and innovation with clear legal frameworks.\n",
