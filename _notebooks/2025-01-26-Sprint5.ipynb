    "# Purpose of your groups program\n",
    "Our team created a platform that allows us to prepare and teach CSP students about Big Idea 2 (about Binary). This is a key part of the CSP course and the different features of our program will test your knowledge and help you prepare for the upcoming AP exam as well as do great in this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose of your individual feature\n",
    "My individual feature is a multiple choice quiz that tests your knowledge on Binary code! This quiz will help you understand what you do or dont know and will save your attempts and scores.\n",
    "- Randomized quiz questions order \n",

    "    Database Initialization (db_init)\n",
    "The db_init function initializes the database by creating required tables and setting up the initial schema. We use this function when starting a new project or resetting an existing database to its default state.\n",

    "The db_backup function allows you to safely back up the current state of your database. This ensures that your data is preserved and can be restored later in case of accidental deletion or other issues.\n",

    "# List requests\n",
    "\n",
    "1) In your API, lists represent rows in a database table, and dictionaries represent the columns. Each record (or row) corresponds to a quiz attempt, and its attributes (like attempt time and quizgrade) are represented as key-value pairs in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "List Requests: When you make a request to the endpoint /api/quizgrading, it returns a list of all quiz attempts in JSON format. This list consists of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a single quiz attempt with keys as column names (attempt, quizgrade).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the QuizGradingAPI class, the get() method retrieves all quiz records:\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/listrequests.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- quizgrading.query.all(): This method retrieves all quiz records from the database as a list (rows).\n",
    "- appending all chats: Each quiz attempt object is converted into a dictionary representing its attributes (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Formatting Response Data (JSON)\n",
    "When the API responds to a request, it formats the data in JSON, which is suitable for communication between a server and a client:\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/quizPOST.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This JSON structure makes it easy to manipulate and display data in the frontend, where each quiz attempt can be rendered in the DOM using JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The Quizgrading API supports the following requests: \n",
    "\n",
    "- GET /api/quizgrading: Retrieve quiz scores and attempts\n",
    "- POST /api/quizgrading: Add a new quiz score and attempt.\n",
    "- PUT /api/quizgrading: Update an existing quiz score and attempt entry.\n",
    "- DELETE /api/quizgrading: Delete a specific quiz attempt and score entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Use of Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "In the API, we use lists to handle multiple quiz score and attempt entries to represent individual entries. The database rows are converted to dictionaries for JSON responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting database rows to list of dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    entries = QuizQradingEntry.query.order_by(QuizGrading.score.desc()).all()\n",
    "    entries_list = [entry.read() for entry in entries]\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Formatting Response Data (JSON) from API into DOM\n",
    "We use Flask’s jsonify function to format the response data as JSON. In the frontend, we use JavaScript to fetch the JSON data from the API and update the DOM. This involves converting the JSON response into HTML elements to display the quiz scores and attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "- @quizgrading_api.route('/api/quizgrading', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_quizgrading():\n",
    "    entries = quizgrading.query.order_by(quizgrading.score.desc()).all()\n",
    "    return jsonify([entry.read() for entry in entries]), 200\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Database Queries\n",
    "We use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy provides methods to query the database and return results as Python lists. For example, we can retrieve all quiz entries sorted by quizgrade or attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Get all entries sorted by score\n",
    "entries = quizgrading.query.order_by(quizgrading.quizgrade.desc()).all()\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Filter by profile name\n",
    "entry = quizgrading.query.filter_by(attempt=attempt).first()\n",
    "\n",
    "# CRUD Methods in Class\n",
    "We define methods in the QuizGrading class to perform CRUD operations on the database:\n",
    "Create: Adds a new entry to the database.\n",
    "Read: Converts a database entry to a dictionary.\n",
    "Update: Updates entry fields with new data.\n",
    "Delete: Removes an entry from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/Crudmethod1.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/Crudmethod2.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/Crudmethod3.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "#  Algorithmic Code Request\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We define API endpoints to handle different types of requests. In “api/quizgrading.py”, I define a class “QuizgradingAPI” which handles different HTTP methods for managing books in my database. This class utilizes the Flask-RESTful framework, allowing me to structure the API cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/API1.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/API2.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/API3.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discussion of a Method/Procedure in the Class\n",
    "The “post” method in the “QuizGradingAPI” class illustrates sequencing, selection, and iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequencing: The method executes a sequence of actions to process a quiz attempt creation request: fetching the JSON data, validating the input, checking for duplicates, and attempting to create a new quiz attempt.\n",
    "Selection: The method uses conditional statements (if-else) to check for required fields, handle existing quiz attempts, and catch exceptions during quiz attempt creation.\n",
    "Iteration: While there’s no explicit iteration in this method, the principles can be seen in similar contexts, such as processing multiple quiz attempt entries when restoring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameters and Return Type\n",
    "Parameters: The “post” method expects a JSON object in the request body containing the quiz attempt. If the request is malformed (missing title), it returns a 400 status code with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Type: The responses are formatted as JSON using “jsonify”, providing clear and structured data for the client.\n",
    "       \n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"New entry created\"}), 201\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Failed to create entry\"}), 400\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Call to Algorithm Request\n",
    "In the frontend, we use the fetch API to make requests to the backend. For example, to submit an attempt, we send a PUT request with the quizgrade and attempt. The response is handled by checking the status and updating the DOM accordingly. If the request is successful, we update the quiz attempt table; if there’s an error, we display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/createattempt.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/loadquiz.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return/Response from Method with Algorithm\n",
    "The “fetch” method captures the response from the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fetch.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code checks the HTTP response status to determine if the request was successful. If not, it extracts the error message from the response and displays it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling Data and Changing responses\n",
    "\n",
    "My application is designed to manage editing and deleting incorrect quiz attempts. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/edit.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow the user to edit their score or attempt number to fix any errors or repeats and to make it more visually pleasing by chaing the attempt time to just the attempt number.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/delete.png\" width = \"600\"  height = \"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
