    "At first this exam was difficult becuase I had never heard some of the key terms. However once I worked with my group to problem solve and use all of our knowledge I was able to understand better. After submitting I reviewed my score of 57/66. It seemed that the areas I struggled the most with was 3.5 Boolean Expressions, 3.16 Simulations, 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency, and 5.4 Crowdsourcing."

    "Originally I put the answer D however this was incorrect as both of the programs showed 10 values, the correct asnwer was C because each program displays 10 values but the values in program B would be one greater then those in program A. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next question I got wrong was #18 which worked with predicting births with a computer model.\n",

    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer I put was B which was wrong because this model would actually help provide a more accurate model. The correct option would have been C because although removing detail would allow the model to run quickly its accuracy is likley to decrease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next question was #24 on Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters. \n",

    "\n",
    "The answer I but was B however I got this incorrect as I did not understand what byte pair encoding was. After some further research and understand what byte pair encoding is I can see that the correct answer is C since the enocded string can be restored back to its orignial version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question I got incorrect was #33 which was about an Apartment rental Web site flowchart.\n",

    "At first I thought that both conditions in the flowchart had to be true since the second bedroom = 3 only if the first floor > 10 was true. This led me to believe that this was the nesessary relationship. However I now understand that since the operator was OR instead of AND, the include would be true if either one of the conditions were also true making A the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question #43 was the next one I got incorrect, it delt with the Runtime of algorithm for an online retailer. \n",

    "At first I thought the answer was B since I thought the items and number of steps didn't have a linear relationship so the algorithm wouldnâ€™t run in reasonable time. However, since the number of steps is polynomial it means that it actually would run in reasonable time making the correct answer A.\n",

    "For this question I was extremly confused when answering it, the option I chose was A but this was incorrect since it would make it false when P and Q are different values. But the NAND gate should only be false when both P and Q are true showing that the answer is C.\n",

    "The next question as #46 about Infinite loops in undecideable problems. \n",

    "This one was a problem that I orginially guessed on and put the answer C, however this was wrong and the correct answer is D becuase I learned that it is impossible to solve undecidable problems for all programs and inputs.\n",

    "The second to last question I got incorrect was #58 about defining Internet enabled crowdsourcing. \n",

    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this answer incorrect because I was slightly unfamilliar with the word, however once better understanding was crowdsourcing is I understand how some problems are not able to be completed in reasonable time making the correct answer A. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last question I got wrong was #65 about Correcting errors in procedure Multiply. \n",

    "I got this question partially correct by understanding that the x is postive y is negative so I assumed it was just a inversly correlated relationship. However the other answer was not C but D because if Y is negative the condtions for = Y will not be met ince the count starts at 0 and increases from there. However, this is a question I am still somewhat confused on. "

It was very helpful to work with my team as they were able to explain things to me along the way that I would likley not have gotten correct on my own. Either way I was proud of my ability to work with others and use some prior knowledge to recive a score that was relatively good. "
