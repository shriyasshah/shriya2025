    " Pros: \n",
    " - \"Made each page and feature flow cohesively\"\n",
    " - \"Very nice variety of games to learn binary\"\n",
    " - \"The UI is really pretty and the game is super fun\"\n",
    "\n",
    " Cons:\n",
    "- \"Page is a little bland, add some more frontend pizzaz\"\n",
    "- \"Only thing I can think of is complicating the styling, like have a more dynamic design to make it more appealing to the user. Like on the game where you translate a hexadecimal number into a bit, it is not just red and blue dots, but images or icons or something. Maybe make the game like.a board game, where there are different paths and possible challenge questions that have risk involved.\"\n",
    "- \"i feel like you could make it more engaging with more features pictures or buttons on the home page\"\n",
