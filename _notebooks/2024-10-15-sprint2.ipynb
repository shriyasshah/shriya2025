    "To start off after we created our teams; we worked together to create our lessons in our groups. My group was incharge of 3.6 and 3.7. Since I was unfamiliar to this topic before, I watctched the AP classroom videos to learn it. Then I created my part of the assingment which taught using exmaples and flow charts. Along with doing my lesson I also completed the homework for each team that taught a topic in Unit 3. Overall this was a good expiernece and I felt like I learnt along from each lesson. \n",
